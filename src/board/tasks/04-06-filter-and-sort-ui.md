# Phase 04 — Filter and sort UI

## Goal

Add interactive filtering and sorting without external dependencies.

## Checklist

  - [ ] choose field: `status|priority|tag|kind`
  - [ ] choose value
- [ ] `s` opens sort prompt:
  - [ ] choose key and order
- [ ] Show active filter/sort in status bar.
- [ ] Provide a way to clear filters/search quickly (e.g. `c`).

## Acceptance

- Filtering and sorting update the view correctly and remain reversible.
