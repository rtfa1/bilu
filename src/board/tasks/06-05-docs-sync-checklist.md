# Phase 06 — Docs sync checklist

## Goal

Keep docs in sync with the implementation as the CLI evolves.

## Checklist

- [ ] Ensure `src/docs/README.md` lists all docs and phases.
- [ ] Ensure `src/docs/bilu-cli.md` documents:
  - [ ] install flow
  - [ ] `bilu board` commands and examples
  - [ ] flags/aliases
  - [ ] `--tui` keybindings (once implemented)
- [ ] Ensure phase docs link to their task files.

## Acceptance

- Docs match behavior and can be used as the primary user guide.
