# Phase 03 — Table view spec

## Goal

Define the exact output contract for `bilu board --list` (table view).

## Checklist

- [ ] Define default view name: `table`.
- [ ] Define columns and their order.
- [ ] Define truncation and wrapping rules.
- [ ] Define whether header and totals are shown.
- [ ] Define what is printed for missing fields (tags/kind/link).
- [ ] Define whether output is stable for scripting (consider a `--format=tsv` later).

## Acceptance

- A sample output snippet is documented and the implementation matches it.
