# Phase 03 — Column mapping and configuration

## Goal

Define how statuses map into displayed columns and how to configure it.

## Checklist

- [ ] Define default mapping (Backlog/In Progress/Review/Done).
- [ ] Decide whether mapping is:
  - [ ] hard-coded initially, or
  - [ ] read from `src/board/config.json` (recommended later)
- [ ] Decide how to treat:
  - [ ] `ARCHIVED`
  - [ ] `CANCELLED`
  - [ ] `showCompletedTasks` config

## Acceptance

- A clear mapping is documented and consistent across renderers.
