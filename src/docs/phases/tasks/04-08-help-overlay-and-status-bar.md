# Phase 04 — Help overlay and status bar

## Goal

Make the TUI discoverable and self-explanatory.

## Checklist

- [ ] `?` toggles help overlay with keybindings.
- [ ] Status bar shows:
  - [ ] active filter/search/sort
  - [ ] counts (total/visible)
  - [ ] hints (`q quit`, `? help`)
- [ ] Ensure overlay doesn’t break layout on small terminals.

## Acceptance

- A new user can operate the TUI without reading external docs.
